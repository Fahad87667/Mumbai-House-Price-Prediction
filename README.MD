## Introduction

The Mumbai House Price Prediction project utilizes Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge regression models to estimate property prices in Mumbai. The goal is to assist potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions by providing reliable predictions.

## Features

- **Regression Models:** Implemented Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge regression algorithms to predict house prices.

- **Feature Engineering:** Processed and engineered features to enhance model performance.

- **Data Visualization:** Utilized visualizations to gain insights into data patterns and relationships.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about properties in Mumbai, including features like bhk,type,locality,area,price,price_unit,region,status,age.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mumbai-house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2.Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge regression models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and other relevant indicators. The evaluation results are presented in the script.
